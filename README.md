# Judgment Pack evaluator experiments

Empirical evidence about the evaluator proposed by the Judgment Pack Specification's
[RFC 0006](https://github.com/Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-spec/blob/main/rfcs/0006-evaluator-conformance.md)
(Draft), in two tracks that answer two different questions and are judged by different standards:

- **Agreement — *do independent implementations produce the same result?*** Clean-room evaluators
  derived from the specification text alone. Their agreement tests whether the prose actually pins
  the semantics; their divergences locate the places it does not. Deterministic, offline, CI-verified.
- **Efficacy — *does representing a policy this way actually help?*** Preregistered experiments on
  third-party benchmarks. API-dependent, costly, non-deterministic, and run manually — never in CI.

The two are kept visibly separate on purpose. Conformance evidence is something a specification
project is the right author of; efficacy evidence is something it is the *wrong* author of, and the
only remedy is method: preregistration, public harness and data, and reported negative results.

**Nothing in this repository claims any JPS conformance.** JPS `0.1.0-draft` defines no evaluator
conformance class and forbids evaluator-conformance claims outright (Core §3.4). Every
implementation here is experimental, may change or be removed without compatibility promise, and
evaluates nothing normatively: a disposition is data, not an authorization, a decision, or an
executed action.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLEAN-ROOM-PROTOCOL.md`](CLEAN-ROOM-PROTOCOL.md) | The reusable recipe every implementation must follow to count as evidence |
| [`reference/`](reference/) | Pinned snapshots of the specification texts the rooms are built from |
| [`harness/`](harness/) | The post-hoc referee: runs identical inputs through implementations and diffs dispositions |
| [`python/`](python/) | **Agreement track.** Implementation #2 (the first lives in [`judgment-pack-runtime`](https://github.com/Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-runtime)): stdlib-only Python, written clean-room by a coding agent from the reference texts, with its interpretation log in [`python/DECISIONS.md`](python/DECISIONS.md) |
| [`studies/`](studies/) | **Efficacy, expressiveness, and interoperability track.** Preregistered experiments on third-party benchmarks and independently developed systems, from policy expressiveness ([`001`](studies/001-policy-representation/)–[`003`](studies/003-escape-census/)) through trustworthy-input lineage ([`005`](studies/005-semantic-source-discovery/)–[`008`](studies/008-portable-derivation-admission/)) to receipt-protocol interoperability ([`013`](studies/013-agent-eval-forge-integration/), [`014`](studies/014-openworkproof-binding/)). See the [studies index](studies/README.md) for the full matrix and the open-source projects each one builds on. |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) | Decision records for this repository — why a given study is being run, and what comes next |

Future implementations (TypeScript, Rust, …) get sibling directories — but the clean room itself
never happens inside this repository: an implementer working here could read the existing
implementations. See the protocol.

### Studies at a glance

Navigation and status only — every finding, and every qualification that finding carries, lives
in the study's own directory. Statuses below are the ones the [studies index](studies/README.md)
records; it remains the canonical matrix, with the external source each study builds on.

This repository claims **no JPS conformance** for anything in it, and the table above adds no
aggregate headline: each study answers a different preregistered question and must be read with
its own qualifications.

## Results so far

### Agreement track

- **13/13 semantic agreement** between the Go reference runtime's experimental evaluator
  (v0.2.0) and `python/` on RFC 0006's nine appendix instances plus three probes — identical
  kind, outcome, reason set, and handoff state ([`harness/README.md`](harness/README.md)).
- **Two specification gaps found** and recorded as RFC 0006 unresolved questions: number
  representability, and the disposition's concrete JSON serialization (the two implementations
  agreed on all semantics while serializing `handoff` incompatibly — see
  [`python/DECISIONS.md`](python/DECISIONS.md) entry 3).

### Efficacy track

Later studies have retained results; each answers a different preregistered question and must be read with its study-level qualifications. On the expressiveness arms below, no comparison arm has been run in either study. Two **expressiveness**
results, on deliberately opposite policy types and by different model families:

| | Study 001 — CBA, arithmetic-dense | Study 002 — airline, qualitative | Study 003 — census, 12 decisions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prepared facts | 124 | 5 | 58 |
| Prepared *determinations* | 13 | 1 | 40 |
| Decisions with ≥1 determination | 1/1 | 1/1 | **12/12** |

The escape is universal in the census frame because real request inputs are collections — and one
device dominates: **quantification over collections forced 25 of 40 determinations** (arithmetic:
6). Encoders were hypothesis-blind; classification was two-way independent with **zero** fact-class
disagreements. See [Study 003](studies/003-escape-census/), [Study 002](studies/002-qualitative-policy/) and
[RFC 0007](https://github.com/Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-spec/blob/main/rfcs/0007-determination-boundary.md).
