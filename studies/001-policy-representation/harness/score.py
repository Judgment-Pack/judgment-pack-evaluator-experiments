Reads one or more result files, groups rows into **conditions**
(``arm::backend::model`` --- a ``::`` separator, because model identifiers
themselves contain slashes), restricts every condition to the **intersection** of
the instance ids they all cover, and reports, for each condition:

* **accuracy** against gold, macro-averaged over instances (each instance
  contributes the mean of its trials, so an instance with more trials does not
  get more weight);
* **pass^k consistency** --- the probability that *all* k trials on an instance are
  correct. A model that is right on average but flips between runs is penalised
  here and nowhere else;
* **citation precision / recall / F1** against the gold ``relevant_rules`` set,
  reported both macro (per-instance mean) and micro (pooled counts);
* **escalation precision, recall and F1** on the redacted twins, from the full
  ``should-escalate x did-escalate`` 2x2 --- never recall alone, because an
  always-escalate agent achieves recall 1.0 and must be visibly punished for it
  by precision;
* **parse-failure rate** and, for arm B, **engine-refusal rate**.

Uncertainty comes from a **paired bootstrap**: instances are resampled with
replacement, the *same* resample is applied to every condition, and every metric
plus every baseline-relative difference is recomputed. Percentile intervals are
reported. ``random.Random`` with a fixed seed; the same inputs give the same
numbers. Alongside it, and only alongside it, **McNemar's test** on the pass^k
indicator. PREREGISTRATION.md section 5 registers "McNemar's test for paired
binary outcomes" and no more: the exact (rather than asymptotic) form, the
two-sided reading, and the choice of the pass^k indicator as the binary are
implementation decisions recorded in DEVIATIONS.md section 4, and the test is
computed for *every* non-baseline condition, of which only the B-vs-A contrast
on the answerable population is the registered primary --- any other cell it
prints is exploratory.

ANALYSIS POPULATION (``--population``, default ``all``)
--------------------------------------------------------
The filter is applied to the paired instance set *after* the cross-condition
intersection, on the instance document's ``variant`` field, which ``redact.py``
stamps into both twins: ``answerable`` keeps the unredacted twins, ``redacted``
keeps their counterparts, ``all`` keeps both and is the shipped behaviour. A
filter that selects nothing is an error, never an empty report.

It exists because of DEVIATIONS.md section 2. PREREGISTRATION.md section 2
registers the primary endpoint as pass^k **on answerable instances**, and the
shipped scorer could not express that population --- it intersected the twin ids
and stopped --- so the first k = 5 write-up reported the composite over all 432
twins as though it were the registered endpoint. On the registered population the
sign of the headline difference flips. A scorer that cannot name the population
it is computing on invites exactly that mistake, so it now names it, and the choice is
recorded in the JSON summary and stated in the markdown header rather than left
to a reader's memory of the command line. The flag does not *know* which
population any given hypothesis registered; it only makes the choice explicit and
auditable.

BOOTSTRAP UNIT (``--bootstrap-unit``, default ``twin``)
--------------------------------------------------------
``twin`` resamples each twin independently. It is the shipped behaviour and it
stays the default: every interval this study has published was computed that way,
and a default that restated them all without a flag, a warning or a note would be
a worse defect than the one the option was added to answer. ``pair`` resamples the
**base-instance clusters** (grouped by ``base_instance_id``): as many clusters are
drawn with replacement as there are clusters, and each drawn cluster contributes
all of its members, so a pair is always in or out together. DEVIATIONS.md section
3 recorded the absence of the clustered option as a deviation; section 4 records
its arrival and the default that was deliberately not changed with it.

What clustering does to an interval here is **measured, not assumed, and it does
not go one way.** Over this study's corpus on the composite population (2000
replicates, seed 20260806) ``pair`` is *narrower* on 15 of the 33 non-degenerate
(condition x metric) intervals --- every accuracy, pass^k and escalation one ---
and wider on the other 18, which are the citation metrics. The headline paired
difference is the clearest case: delta pass^k, B - A is [0.100, 0.160] clustered
against [0.076, 0.181] unclustered, 42% narrower. The mechanism is mechanical
rather than statistical: in this corpus every cluster is exactly one answerable
twin plus its redacted counterpart (216 clusters, all of size two), so a cluster
resample holds the answerable:redacted mix at exactly 50% in every replicate and
removes the mixture-composition variance that dominates the composite population.
That is stratification, and wanting it is defensible --- but it is the opposite of
"the twins are dependent, so clustering must widen the interval", and this file
will not carry a justification its own data contradicts. On the registered
``answerable`` population the choice is inert, so the primary endpoint does not
turn on it either way.

Under ``--population answerable`` (likewise ``redacted``) every cluster is a
singleton, so the two units consume the same random draws from the same seed and
give identical resamples and identical intervals; the flag only bites on the
composite population.

WHEN THE ESCALATION 2x2 IS NOT ESTIMABLE
------------------------------------------
The escalation metrics cross should-escalate (a redacted twin) against
did-escalate. That table needs **both** of its rows to be non-empty, and an
analysis set restricted to one variant has only one of them --- so on
``--population answerable`` there is no should-escalate instance, recall is 0/0,
and precision is 0.0 whatever the arm did (its numerator is a structural zero);
on ``--population redacted`` there is no should-NOT-escalate instance, so
precision cannot be wrong --- it is 1.0 for any arm that escalates at all --- and
F1 collapses to a monotone function of recall, which is the recall-alone number
PREREGISTRATION.md section 5 forbids reporting.
``aggregate`` returns 0.0 for an empty denominator because it must return a
float into the bootstrap, so left alone the report would print "escalation F1
0.000, 95% CI [0.000, 0.000]" and a paired difference of the same --- a number
that reads as a precisely estimated null and is in fact an artefact of the
population. That is the failure DEVIATIONS.md section 2 records, and the
``--population`` flag would have reintroduced it.

So: whenever the analysis set is missing either row of the 2x2, escalation
precision, recall and F1 are reported as **undefined** --- ``null`` in the JSON
summary, ``n/a`` in the markdown, and the section heading says NOT ESTIMABLE ---
in the point estimate, the interval and the paired difference alike. The
**counts** are still counts and are still printed: on the answerable population
the should-not-but-did column is the numerator of the false-escalation **rate**
that PREREGISTRATION.md section 6 names as H2's explicit cost criterion (the
registered quantity is the rate; the count over the population's trials is how
it is computed), and it is the reason the table is annotated rather than
dropped. The condition is a
property of the analysis set, not of the flag: an intersection that happens to
contain no redacted twin is suppressed the same way.

MCNEMAR'S EXACT TEST (PREREGISTRATION.md section 5)
----------------------------------------------------
Section 5 registers "paired bootstrap confidence intervals ... and McNemar's
test for paired binary outcomes". The paired binary outcome is the per-instance
pass^k indicator (``InstanceStats.all_correct``). For every non-baseline
condition, over the analysis population, the scorer counts the discordant
instances --- the ones the baseline got right and the condition did not, and the
reverse --- and reports the exact two-sided binomial p,
``min(1, 2 * P(X <= min(b, c)))`` for ``X ~ Binomial(b + c, 1/2)``, computed in
exact integer arithmetic and converted to float only at the end. No normal
approximation and no continuity correction: at these counts the exact test is
free. ``n_discordant == 0`` gives p = 1.0. Concordant instances carry no
information for this test and are not counted by it.

SCORING CONVENTIONS (fixed here, so they cannot drift between analyses)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Gold decision is ``"illegal"`` when ``gold.answer`` is true, ``"legal"`` when it
  is false, and ``"cannot_decide"`` for a redacted twin --- on a redacted
  instance, abstaining *is* the right answer.
* A **parse failure is a wrong answer** and is **not** an escalation. It is also
  counted separately so a condition cannot hide behind unparseable output.
* An **arm-B engine refusal** is likewise a wrong, non-escalating answer, per the
  preregistered rule.
* ``cited_rules`` is compared as a **set** after normalisation to lowercase
  alphanumerics. RuleArena's gold column spells a handful of identifiers
  inconsistently (``nontaxpayer_...`` vs ``non_taxpayer_...``); normalising means
  the citation metric measures rule identification, not spelling. Instances whose
  gold carries no ``relevant_rules`` are excluded from citation metrics only.
* Empty-vs-empty citation sets score 1.0; predicting a non-empty set against an
  empty gold scores precision 0.0.
* ``pass^k`` uses the first k trials in trial order, where k is the smallest trial
  count any condition has for that instance, so the comparison is like for like.

REDACTED-TWIN DETECTION (the contract this file consumes)
----------------------------------------------------------
An instance should escalate when, in priority order:

1. ``gold.should_escalate`` is a boolean --- that value wins;
2. ``variant`` is ``"redacted"`` / ``"answerable"`` --- ``redact.py``'s own label,
   which is authoritative because it stamps a ``redaction`` record into **both**
   twins of a pair (the answerable twin records what its counterpart lost);
3. ``expected_decision == "cannot_decide"``;
4. ``instance["redaction"]["applied"]`` is true, or, for documents that predate
   that key, ``instance["redaction"]`` is present and truthy;
5. the ``instance_id`` ends with ``#redacted`` / ``-redacted`` or contains
   ``#redacted-``.

Its non-redacted partner is ``pair_id`` when present, else
``redaction.base_instance_id``, else the id with that suffix stripped. Every other
instance is a should-NOT-escalate case and is included in the 2x2, which is what
makes always-escalate score badly.

INSTANCE IDENTITY
-----------------
``redact.py`` gives the two twins of a pair the **same** ``instance_id`` --- they
are the same problem --- and tells them apart with ``twin_id``. Rows and
instances are therefore keyed by ``twin_id`` when it is present (``arms.
instance_key``), matching the ``row_id`` that ``run.py`` writes. Keying on
``instance_id`` would collapse each pair into one instance and silently destroy
the escalation design.

SUMMARY SCHEMA
--------------
The JSON summary is ``jps-study-001-score/3``. Version 2 added five fields and
removes none: top-level ``population`` and ``bootstrap_unit`` (the two choices
above, recorded so a report says on what it was computed), ``bootstrap_clusters``
(how many resampling units the bootstrap drew from) and ``escalation_estimable``
(whether the 2x2 has both its rows on this analysis set), plus
``mcnemar_pass_at_k`` on every **non-baseline** condition ---
``n_baseline_only_correct``, ``n_condition_only_correct``, ``n_discordant``,
``p_value``. The baseline condition carries no such entry: a condition has no
discordant instances against itself, and writing p = 1.0 there would look like a
result. Everything version 1 wrote is still written and still means the same
thing, with one deliberate exception in one new situation: when
``escalation_estimable`` is false the three escalation rate metrics are ``null``
instead of the 0.0 a version-1 report would have printed, in ``point``, in
``ci95`` and in ``delta_vs_baseline``. Reaching it takes an analysis set missing
one row of the 2x2, which the study's own runs are not (216 twins of each
variant, all paired), so on this corpus ``--population all --bootstrap-unit
twin`` reproduces a version-1 report's numbers exactly --- checked field by field
against ``results/k5-report.json``, which differs only in ``schema`` and in the
added fields.

Version 3 adds two more fields and removes none. ``analysis_role`` is
``registered-primary`` when the run is on the configuration
``REGISTERED_ANALYSIS`` names and ``secondary`` otherwise --- including on the
defaults, which are the shipped behaviour rather than the registered one.
``registered_primary`` records whether the registered endpoint is estimable at
all from this analysis set and, when it is not, every reason why. The reason
that matters here is not hypothetical: the endpoint is pooled across both model
families, only Codex ran, and this scorer has no cross-backend pooling
operation, so no invocation of it can produce that endpoint. Marking the
all-twins run ``secondary`` is the same guard in the other direction --- that
population is what the first draft reported as though it were primary. Every
version-2 field is still written and still means the same thing.

WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
---------------------------------------
* No unpaired comparisons and no "best of the trials". Conditions are only ever
  compared on the shared instance set.
* No recall-only escalation number, anywhere.
* Exactly one significance test: McNemar's exact test on the pass^k indicator,
  computed because PREREGISTRATION.md section 5 registers it and its absence from
  this file was a recorded deviation (DEVIATIONS.md section 3). No OTHER test is
  added --- no test on accuracy, on the citation metrics, or on the escalation
  2x2, all of which carry bootstrap intervals and the bootstrap probability that
  a difference exceeds zero, and nothing else.
* No multiplicity correction, because the study registered one primary endpoint;
  a p reported beside a secondary metric would need one, so none is reported.
* No decision rule. The scorer prints the counts and the p; whether a hypothesis
  passed is settled by the falsification criteria in PREREGISTRATION.md section
  6, not here.
* No repair of malformed rows, no imputation of missing trials.
* No knowledge of which population a hypothesis registered: ``--population``
  makes the analysis set explicit and auditable, it does not choose it.
