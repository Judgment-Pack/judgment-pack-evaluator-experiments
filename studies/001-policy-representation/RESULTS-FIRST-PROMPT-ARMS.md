# Results — Study 001, first execution of the prompt arms

Arms A and A′ had never been run against a real model beyond a
two-instance pilot, so the project's central claim — that representing a
policy as a judgment pack changes how reliably a model applies it — rested
on a design rather than a result. All three arms have now run over the
full corpus at k = 5.

**On the preregistered endpoint, the pack arm loses.** An earlier draft of
this document reported the opposite; it scored the wrong population and
was corrected by the post-run adversarial review
([`ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW.md`](ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW.md), five blockers). The
error and its correction are recorded in `DEVIATIONS.md` §2 rather than
silently fixed.

## Setup

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Instances | 432 twins (216 answerable, 216 redacted), byte-identical facts across arms |
| Trials | k = 5, all conditions; 2,160 rows per arm; 0 errors, parse-ok 1.000 |
| Arms | A (CBA text in prompt), A′ (pack prose in prompt), B (pack via evaluator) |
| Model | `gpt-5.6-sol` via Codex, arms A and A′ |
| Runtime | `judgment-pack 0.2.0`, arm B |
| Bootstrap | 2000 paired resamples of individual twins (`--bootstrap-unit twin`, the scorer's default), seed 20260806 |

Two notes on how to read the arm-B row of that table. Arm B's "0 errors"
was computed under the permissive refusal rule `DEVIATIONS.md` §3 records
— a non-zero exit was a refusal only when stdout was also empty — and the
retained rows carry no exit status, so it cannot be checked against them.
The rule was tightened after these numbers were read (§4), and the
deterministic arm was then re-run under the strict rule the same day
(`DEVIATIONS.md` §5): `results/k5-B-runtime-audited.jsonl` retains an
exit code and stderr on every row — all 2,160 exit 0 — and reproduces
every disposition and trace byte-identically, so "0 engine refusals" is
now auditable for that corpus. Every interval below is a twin-level
resample; the pair-clustered alternative now exists behind
`--bootstrap-unit pair` and is used only where this document says so.

## The registered primary endpoint — H1 — is **not supported**

§2 of the preregistration registers exactly one primary endpoint: **H1
measured as pass^k on answerable instances**, arm B against arm A, pooled
across both model families. On that population:

| Arm | pass^5 | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| A — policy text in the prompt | **0.727** | [0.667, 0.787] |
| A′ — pack prose in the prompt | **0.778** | [0.718, 0.833] |
| B — pack through the evaluator | 0.579 | [0.509, 0.644] |

**Δ pass^5, B − A = −0.148, 95% CI [−0.213, −0.088].** Exact two-sided
McNemar on the 56 discordant instances (12 favouring B, 44 favouring A):
**p = 2.09 × 10⁻⁵, favouring A.**

The result is **opposite in sign** to the hypothesis. §6 required B to
exceed A by at least 5 points with an interval excluding zero; B trails by
nearly 15 points with an interval excluding zero in A's favour.

**H5 is not supported either.** B − A′ = −0.199 [−0.255, −0.148]. §6 makes
the headline claim fail when B does not exceed A′, and it does not. A′
does exceed A on this endpoint (+0.051 [0.009, 0.093]) while their
accuracy difference is not distinguishable from zero.

**And the registered endpoint was never completed.** It is defined as
pooled across Claude and Codex. Only Codex ran, and `score.py` produces
separate `arm::backend::model` conditions with no cross-backend pooling
operation — so the pooled endpoint is not merely deviated but not
estimable from this execution. Everything above is a Codex-only deviated
analysis.

### What the earlier draft got wrong

It reported **B − A = +0.130** and "H1 passes". That number is
reproducible, but only by scoring **all 432 twins** — pooling the 216
answerable instances with the 216 manufactured-redaction ones. The
decomposition:

| Population | B − A, pass^5 |
| --- | ---: |
| Answerable (the registered population) | **−0.148** [−0.213, −0.088] |
| Redacted (manufactured abstention labels) | +0.407 [0.343, 0.472] |
| All twins (the unregistered composite) | +0.130 [0.076, 0.181] |

The manufactured stratum changes the sign. As it stood then, `score.py`
intersected all shared twin ids and never filtered to
`variant == "answerable"`; the scorer did not enforce the registered
population, and the author did not either. It now takes a `--population`
flag and records the choice in the report — which makes the analysis set
auditable, not automatic; the flag still cannot know which population a
hypothesis registered (`DEVIATIONS.md` §4).

## Accuracy against RuleArena's own gold — H4 **not supported**

§5 defines accuracy as agreement with the benchmark's gold `answer`. On
answerable instances, against that gold:

| Arm | Accuracy | 
| --- | ---: |
| A | **0.781** |
| A′ | 0.778 |
| B | 0.579 |

**B − A = −0.202 [−0.262, −0.146].** The pack arm is about twenty points
worse on the benchmark's actual labels. The +0.100 reported earlier is
reproducible only after adding author-constructed abstention labels for
the redacted half.

## Why: the expressiveness gap, which is the real finding

**Arm B returns `cannot_decide` on 60 of 216 answerable instances**
because the benchmark omits the minimum-salary schedule the CBA needs
(`PIPELINE-STATUS.md` §7 G-1). Those 60 instances are *all* 300 of B's
false-escalation trials. The pack is not deciding wrongly on them; it
cannot decide at all, because a constant it requires does not exist
anywhere in the benchmark.

§6 of the preregistration anticipated exactly this: *"If the pack cannot
be authored to cover a usable fraction of instances at all, that is the
study's result and it is published as an expressiveness finding, not
quietly rescoped."* That is the finding. On the 156 answerable instances
the pack can decide, its accuracy is 80.1%; the endpoint loss is driven by
the 60 it cannot reach.

A second error concentration (G-3): B calls **18 of 37** gold-legal
answerable instances illegal. The cause is no longer unknown — every one
of the 18 is diagnosed to a named `derive.py` field or pack rule in
[`G3-DIAGNOSIS.md`](G3-DIAGNOSIS.md), each verified by counterfactual
through the same `judgment-pack 0.2.0` binary (6 derivation defects, 8
pack encoding errors, 2 disputable gold labels, 2 genuinely ambiguous;
the 6/8 split is tie-break-convention-dependent and the note says so).
Its sharpest consequence bears on G-2: correcting all four derivation
defects *lowers* arm B's answerable accuracy from 0.579 to 0.551, because
the same defects were also producing right answers for wrong reasons on
twelve gold-illegal instances. The pipeline's errors partly compensate,
so the arm-B score does not decompose into "pack quality" plus
"preprocessor quality".

## Escalation — H2 **holds** on its registered criterion

| Arm | TP | FP | FN | TN | precision | recall | F1 | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| A | 26 | 12 | 1054 | 1068 | 0.684 | 0.024 | 0.047 | [0.014, 0.087] |
| A′ | 67 | 51 | 1013 | 1029 | 0.568 | 0.062 | 0.112 | [0.062, 0.171] |
| B | 460 | 300 | 620 | 780 | 0.605 | 0.426 | **0.500** | [0.436, 0.561] |

Δ F1, B − A = +0.453; pair-clustered over the 216 source pairs the
interval is [0.397, 0.505] (`--bootstrap-unit pair`, which now reproduces
that hand-computed figure). H2 meets its registered F1 rule.

These escalation numbers are the composite over all 432 twins, which is
the only population the 2×2 has both rows on: restricted to one variant,
one row is empty and precision, recall and F1 are undefined rather than
zero. The scorer now says so instead of printing them as 0.000
(`DEVIATIONS.md` §4).

The cost §6 names explicitly is the false-escalation **rate**, and it is
large: **1.1% of answerable trials for A (12/1080) versus 27.8% for B
(300/1080)** — plus 26.7 points, a 25× rise. Of B's 92 redacted
abstentions, 60 were already abstentions on the answerable twin; only 32
of 216 pairs newly switched from a decision to an abstention.

So B's escalation advantage and its endpoint loss have **the same cause**:
it abstains on the 60 instances it cannot express. That is right behaviour
on the redacted twins and wrong behaviour on the answerable ones, and the
manufactured-label design rewards it for the former.

## Citation — H3 **fails**

| Arm | precision | recall | F1 | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| A | 0.780 | 0.217 | **0.302** | [0.284, 0.322] |
| A′ | 0.679 | 0.164 | 0.239 | [0.225, 0.253] |
| B | 0.597 | 0.117 | 0.186 | [0.174, 0.199] |

B − A = −0.116 [−0.142, −0.092]. The pack cites the benchmark's relevant
rules worse than either prompt arm.

## What this execution does and does not compare

- **Arm B's within-instance decision agreement is 1.0 by construction** —
  the evaluator is deterministic. So its pass^5 *equals* its accuracy
  (0.579), which removes B's repeat-variation penalty and structurally
  favours it on pass^k. It does **not** make pass^k 1.0, and it does not
  guarantee B wins: here B loses the endpoint anyway.
- **The design does not hold the decision mechanism fixed.** It compares a
  prompted language model against a deterministic evaluator executing a
  pack. Representation is not varied in isolation.
- **The pack does not do the arithmetic.** 124 `/facts/derived/*` values
  are supplied by a preprocessor, 13 of them legal characterisation rather
  than computation. Every arm received the identical derived block, so the
  comparison is even-handed, but the result is about the
  pack-plus-preprocessor pipeline, not the pack alone.
- **Escalation gold is ours by construction.** RuleArena has no "cannot
  decide" condition; the redaction operator manufactures one. 213 of 216
  pairs are classified strong and 3 weak, and only 90 redactions alter the
  derived block the evaluator consumes — on 126 pairs the inputs B sees
  are unchanged (G-4).
- **One model family, one benchmark, one policy domain, one pack author.**

## Reproduction note

Arm B reproduced the recorded 2026-07-27 result exactly — 235 `illegal`,
45 `legal`, 152 `cannot_decide`, 217/432 — from twins regenerated
byte-identically from the pinned benchmark commit.

## Deviations

`DEVIATIONS.md` records: one model family rather than two; arm B on
`judgment-pack 0.2.0`; the wrong-population error corrected here; the
preregistered McNemar test absent from `score.py` when this document was
written and computed by hand for it; bootstrap resampling over twins
rather than pair clusters in the scorer that produced these intervals; and
an arm-B refusal check that could score a non-zero exit as a success.

`DEVIATIONS.md` §4 records what was done about the last three **after**
these numbers were read: McNemar and a `--bootstrap-unit pair` option were
implemented and reproduce the hand-computed values above, and the arm-B
check was tightened. **No number in this document changed as a result**:
the scorer's default resampling unit was deliberately left at `twin` so
these intervals remain what its recorded command produces, and the
strict-rule re-run (`DEVIATIONS.md` §5) reproduced every disposition
byte-identically with all 2,160 exit codes retained as 0 — so the figures
above stand, and the "0 errors" claim is now checkable against
`results/k5-B-runtime-audited.jsonl` instead of resting on the old rule.
The registered-population analysis, scorer-produced end to end, is
committed as `results/k5-report-answerable.{json,md}`.
