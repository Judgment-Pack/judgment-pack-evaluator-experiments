# What 461 lines of regulatory text look like as a judgment pack

**An expressiveness report from Study 001.** Not an efficacy claim: no comparison arm has been run,
and nothing here says whether judgment packs help anyone. This reports only what happened when the
format was pointed at real regulatory text and asked to carry it.

Everything below is reproducible from the pinned artifacts in this directory. The subject is the JPS
`0.1.0-draft` format and the reference runtime's experimental evaluator (`judgment-pack` v0.2.0),
which claims no conformance.

## What was encoded

461 lines of the NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement, as published in
[RuleArena](https://github.com/skyriver-2000/RuleArena) (ACL 2025, MIT, commit `3b9e2256`) — real
regulatory prose, not a synthesized policy. The decision: *is this set of roster operations legal?*

The pack was authored clean-room by a coding agent from the CBA text and the benchmark's rule-name
vocabulary alone; no instance, gold answer, or answer distribution was read. It validates at
`exit 0` and its 61 rules cover **61 / 61** of the vocabulary the benchmark uses to annotate which
provisions govern each instance.

## What the format carried well

- **The rules themselves.** 61 provisions encoded as conditions over facts, each citing the CBA
  article and section it came from. Citation is native, not bolted on.
- **Uncertainty as a first-class result.** Every rule carries `onUnknown: escalate`. When a fact an
  applicable rule needs is absent, the evaluation resolves to `unresolved` with a reason and a
  handoff request rather than guessing. Across 432 evaluations there were **zero engine refusals** —
  every input produced a disposition or an explicit escalation.
- **Multiple simultaneous violations.** Three independent violations produce one `illegal` outcome
  citing three rules, with no conflict.

## What the format could not carry — four findings

### 1. No arithmetic, so 124 facts had to be computed elsewhere

JPS compares facts; it has no arithmetic. Every quantity the CBA reasons about — post-transaction
team salary, apron comparisons, maximum-salary tiers, year-over-year escalation — must be supplied
to the pack rather than derived by it. The pack requires **124 `/facts/derived/*` fields**: 39
always-present booleans, 18 conditional booleans, 67 conditional decimal strings.

The pack holds the constants (25/30/35 %, 105 %, 175 %, 120 %, 130 %, 5 %, 8 %, …) and the
preprocessor holds the division. That division is a defensible split — but it means a reader of the
pack alone cannot see the whole decision.

### 2. Part of the *reasoning* migrated out, not just the arithmetic

This is the sharper version of finding 1. **13 of the 39 always-present booleans name which Salary
Cap Exception a transaction invokes.** The source prose never states one; working it out is the
legal reasoning the benchmark exists to test. Selecting "the lowest tier whose limb covers the
amount" requires comparing against a computed limb, which the format cannot express — so the
selection lives in the preprocessor.

The consequence for any evaluation: a score for the pack is partly a score for the preprocessor.
We report it, but we do not claim it measures the format.

### 3. The format can say *unknown*, but not *immaterial*

**The pack cannot decide 28 % of instances** (60 of 216). Almost all trace to one cause: the Minimum
Player Salary schedule appears in *neither* the CBA excerpt *nor* the benchmark's stipulations — it
is nowhere in the corpus. 77 of 216 instances contain a contract stated at "minimum applicable player
salary". A preprocessor that refuses to invent the figure cannot compute those teams' salaries, the
fields are omitted, the rules go `unknown`, and the instance escalates.

A language model reading the same text handles this by treating minimum contracts as *immaterial* —
too small to change the answer — and proceeds. **The pack cannot, because JPS has no "immaterial".**
Its three-valued logic distinguishes true, false, and unknown; it has no way to say "this input is
missing but too small to matter."

This is arguably the most interesting boundary the exercise found. It is not a bug in the pack, and
we deliberately did not fix it by inventing a number.

### 4. Conflict semantics force a single-outcome architecture

§8 treats two *distinct* candidate outcomes as `conflict` → `unresolved`. A pack containing both
affirmative "this is legal" rules and "this is illegal" rules therefore goes unresolved whenever one
of each fires — which, in a domain of independent provisions, is common.

The pack is consequently built as **61 violation detectors that all resolve to `illegal`, with
`legal` reachable only as `fallbackOutcome`.** That works, and it makes every fired rule an
independently reportable citation. But it is a workaround discovered by the author, not a documented
pattern, and it means the format nudges hard toward "detect violations, default to the good outcome"
rather than "weigh the considerations."

## What this suggests

For a decision of this shape — dense, arithmetic-heavy regulatory computation — **JPS expressed the
*policy* faithfully and a substantial part of the *determination* migrated into a preprocessor the
format cannot describe.** The pack is an honest, citable, machine-checkable statement of the rules.
It is not, on its own, the decision procedure.

Whether that is a limitation or a correct separation of concerns depends on a question the
specification has not answered: **is the fact-preparation layer inside the format's remit or outside
it?** Today it is outside, invisible, and unattributable — the disposition cannot say "this answer
depended on a derived value someone else computed under this definition."

Two questions go to the specification from this exercise, and are the subject of a companion RFC:
derived values and their attribution, and materiality.

## Honest limits of this note

- **One domain, and an adversarial one.** NBA transaction legality is arithmetic-dense by design.
  A format that declines to compute is playing away from home here. Nothing in this note transfers
  to qualitative policy without repeating the exercise there.
- **One pack, authored by one coding agent** in a clean room, in roughly a day. A domain expert with
  more time might encode more, though not the arithmetic — that boundary is structural.
- **The 28 % undecidable figure is partly a corpus property**, not purely a format property: the
  missing salary schedule is absent from the benchmark, not from the CBA in the world.
- **No efficacy claim.** Arms A and A′ have not been run. See
  [PIPELINE-STATUS.md](PIPELINE-STATUS.md) for the full gap list, including two that would bias any
  future comparison.
