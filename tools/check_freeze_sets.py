"""Refuse a study whose freeze set covers a file meant to be appended after it.

A whole-study manifest exists to pin what MUST NOT change. `DEVIATIONS.md` is
the opposite: its purpose is to be written *after* the freeze, when a study finds
something its registration did not anticipate. Covering it turns recording a
deviation into an edit of a frozen artifact, so the study must choose between
leaving the problem unrecorded and breaking its own anchor. Both are worse than
the problem. `README.md` is the same shape for a different reason: its status
banner is false the moment the attempt runs.

This reads each study's GENERATED manifest, not its builder's source. That is
deliberate. The first version of this guard parsed `make_manifest.py` for string
literals and reported Study 015 as clean — 015 covers every top-level `*.md` by
glob and names neither file, so a source scan sees nothing while the manifest
would have carried both. 015 is in fact the strongest implementation: it globs
widely and then excludes the two BY CONSTRUCTION, after its own round 6 found an
earlier exclusion tautological because no glob had ever reached a top-level
`.md`. A guard that could be defeated by a glob would repeat exactly that defect.
The manifest is the covered set; anything else is a description of it.
